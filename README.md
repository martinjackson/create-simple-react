# create-simple-react

A "Quick Start" for React on the frontend and NodeJS on the backend.
An alternative to other ways to start a React project.  This will create a project ready for production 
or a play area to trry out React.

## Creating a new Project

```bash
npm init simple-react [New Project Directory] {--verbose} {--help}
```
### Example

```bash
cd ~/projects
npm init simple-react@latest lab-status
```
__-OR-__

```bash
cd ~/projects
npx create-simple-react@latest lab-status
```


   3 minutes later...

```bash
cd lab-status
npm start
```

   open a browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

------------------------------------------------------

There is no ejecting !!  

This project was ruled by these concepts:

1. K.I.S.S. -- Keep It Sublimely Simple
2. D.R.Y. -- Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Everything in plain sight
4. React Frontend, NodeJS backend example
5. Project structure near ready for Production (just change webpack config from development to production, add minifiy)

## for those you want to tinker ...
the config files are in the root directory with the package.json file.  If you mess them up, you have two choices:
- use git to revert back
- remove the messed up files and  run create-simple-react on the same directory again. It will restore
the original config files.
_Note: create-simple-react will not replace existing files_
