adding watch:true   to webpack.config.js


/*
  watch: true,          // enables watching
    ^^^^  instead of --watch on the command line creates the following:

    (node:8708) [DEP_WEBPACK_WATCH_WITHOUT_CALLBACK] DeprecationWarning: A 'callback' argument need to be provided to the 'webpack(options, callback)' function when the 'watch' option is set. There is no way to handle the 'watch' option without a callback.
    (Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
