# create-simple-react

An alternative to create-react-app, no eject, opinionated for a shop standard.

_Would you like a feature comparision between this project and React's create-react-app?_

There is no ejecting !!  for those you want to tinker, the config files
are in the root directory with the package.json file.  If you mess them up, you have two choices:
- use git to revert back
- remove the messed up files and  run create-simple-react on the same directory again. It will restore
the original config files.
_Note: create-simple-react will not replace existing files_

This project was ruled by these concepts:

1. K.I.S.S. -- Keep It Sublimely Simple
2. D.R.Y. -- Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Everything in plain sight
4. React Frontend, NodeJS backend example
5. Project structure near ready for Production (just change webpack config from development to production, add minifiy)

__Please send ideas on improvements__
