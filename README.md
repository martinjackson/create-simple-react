# create-simple-react

An alternative to create-react-app, no eject, opinionated for a shop standard.

There is no ejecting !!  for those you want to tinker, the config files
are in the root directory with the package.json file.  If you mess them up, you have two choices:
- use git to revert back
- remove the messed up files and  run create-simple-react on the same directory again. It will restore
the original config files.
Note: create-simple-react will not replace existing files

This project was ruled by three concepts:

1. K.I.S.S. -- Keep It Sublimely Simple
2. D.R.Y. -- Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Everything in plain sight

Please send ideas on improvements

Version 0.6.1    Example code for both React Class and React Hooks (Jest test examples too!)
